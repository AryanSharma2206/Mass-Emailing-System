## üìù Getting Started

### 1. Clone This Repo

git clone https://github.com/AryanSharma2206/Mass-Emailing-System.git
cd Mass-Emailing-System

text

### 2. AWS Setup

- **S3 Bucket:** Create a bucket for CSV uploads
- **SES Setup:** Verify your sender identity (and recipient(s) if still in SES sandbox)
- **Lambda:** Deploy Lambda, add IAM permissions
- **S3 Trigger:** Set S3 to invoke Lambda on new CSV upload

### 3. Prepare Your CSV

email,first_name,last_name
example1@email.com,First,Last
example2@email.com,Another,Person

text

Upload your CSV to the bucket.

### 4. Monitor and Verify

- **Logs:** See [CLOUDE-WATCH.png](Mass-Email-project/CLOUDE-WATCH.png)
- **Email receipt:** See [Recived-email.png](Mass-Email-project/Recived-email.png)

## üóùÔ∏è Example IAM Policy (Lambda)

For S3 access:
{

"Action": ["s3:GetObject"],
"Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::email-bucket-010/*"
}

text
Add "ses:SendEmail" permissions as well.
